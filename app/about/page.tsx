          Welcome to the Southern Cross AI project! We are a pioneering
          initiative aimed at developing Australia's first open-source Large
          Language Model (LLM). Our project brings together a diverse team of
          experts from academia, research, government, and business sectors,
          united by a shared vision of advancing AI technology in Australia. At
          Southern Cross AI, we are committed to fostering innovation,
          collaboration, and knowledge sharing to create a sovereign Australian
          LLM tailored to the unique linguistic and contextual nuances of our
          country. Our mission is to empower Australian businesses and
          government agencies with cutting-edge AI solutions that drive
          efficiency, productivity, and competitiveness. With a focus on
          transparency, inclusivity, and ethical AI practices, we strive to
          build a community-driven project that not only delivers groundbreaking
          technology but also fosters a culture of trust, integrity, and
          accountability. Together, we are shaping the future of AI in Australia
          and beyond.
